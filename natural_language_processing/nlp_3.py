# Start off my importing the NLTK module.
import nltk

# In this tutorial, we will focus on *WordNet*: a lexical 
# database for the English language. WordNet groups English words 
# into sets of synonyms, called *synsets*, and provides brief 
# definitions and usage examples along with recording a number of 
# relationships among the synonym sets. 

# WordNet can be thought of as an online resource that combines 
# the functionality of both a dictionary and thesaurus. 

# WordNet may be accessed via NLTK. For more information on WordNet, 
# consult the following:
