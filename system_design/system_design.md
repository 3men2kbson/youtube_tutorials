# Clarification

- You are given a purposefully vague question. Part of the assessment of the interviewer is to see how well you handle vague requirements.
- Similar to a more standard technical interview question, you should clarify ambiguous points with your interviewer. 
- This gives them a good picture as to how you will deal with these scenarios on the job.
