# Clarification

- You are given a purposefully vague question. Part of the assessment of the 
interviewer is to see how well you handle vague requirements.

- Similar to a more standard technical interview question, you should clarify
 ambiguous points with your interviewer. 

- This gives them a good picture as to how you will deal with these scenarios
 on the job.

# Asking Good Questions

- The purpose of asking clarifying questions is to dispel the ambiguity and
  to uncover an actionable piece of the puzzle. 

- A good question will give direction and determine the needs of the customer.

- Implementing something completely different than what the customer wants
 certainly has bad implications for the company. Try to whittle away at
 the problem statement until the scope, motivation, and direction is clear.

- It is better to ask a question that seems trivial than to assume the intent
 and as a result implement the wrong solution for the problem statement.

# Tackling the Problem 

- Ensure that prior to proposing any solution or code that you understand
 the problem statement and can reiterate it back to the interviewer.

- Furthermore, make sure that you have a solid grasp on the constraints,
 bottlenecks, scope, goals, etc. of the problem you are attempting to solve.

- Understanding all of these components will make solving the problem itself
 much less daunting.

# Focusing Scope 

- Depending on your background if asked to design a large software service,
 like Facebook for instance, your response will most likely be based on
 your area of expertise.

- For instance, if you are a front-end developer, you may spend more time
 on designing the user interface and if you are a back-end developer, you
 may decide to speak more on that side. The focus also of course depends
 on the role to which you are applying for.

- Since system design interviews are generally given to candidates who have
 had previous experience, you can showcase your specialty
